    <h1> Welcome to the About Me </h1>
  <p> My name is Nathaniel Brown, I'm an English major who is also pursuing a minor in education. I plan on seeking a TEFL certification
after my time here at URI, with the aims of teaching English overseas somewhere as a foreign language. I'm taking this CSC course because it
meets a math requirement for my major and I really wanted to avoid doing any form of mathematics. I'm going to be opting out of posting images
of myself and linking social medias (Not that I have any). I've never been one for posting myself online or even taking photos, ever since I was little kid.
Not starting that now. Here is a sad frog man that I drew, we can call him me. For the second image of "me" here is Danny Devito photoshopped onto a cheese puff.</p>
