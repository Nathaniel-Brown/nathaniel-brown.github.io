  <h1 class="center"> Welcome to the page! </h1>
  <p class="center"> This site is going to be used as hub for submitting and displaying some projects done throughout the semester. It will be consistently updated and improved upon. There are a few main sections to the site. Home: Used as our entry point to the site, describing everything you see here and giving you a guide to the other sections of the page. Apps: This will be where I will insert links to the apps that I write in this course. Java: Will be where I link javascript programs created in the class. About Me: This is where you'll expect me to post a lot of personal information and images of myself, but I will not be doing that and uploading alternative content in its stead. There will also be a brief paragraph about me. </p>
