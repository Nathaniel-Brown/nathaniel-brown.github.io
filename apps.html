  <h1 class="center"> Final Project! </h1>
  <p class="center"> For my final project I created the game dodge rock, I wanted to do dodge ball, but alas I did not find a ball image
     in the khan database. The program uses the a mixture of variables, expressions, conditional statements, loops, functions and arrays
    in order to demonstrate my ability with what we have learned. <br>
    My goal here was to establish a game of "Dodge ball", but with rocks. You as a player would run up and down the gymnasium attmepting to
dodge the rocks. You will be given a point for each time you reach the top and each time you reach the bottom. Every time you are hit while
 making the trek you lose one point off of your score. At the end you are shown how many times you made it across without being hit and how
 many times you were hit! <br>
Here is my project! I hope you enjoy. This class was a bit much for me, so please don't be to harsh with your responses. <3 I'm just trying to
   get my math credit... Not looking for a future in coding. <br> </p>
